# ETCDevs
A directory of links to Ethereum Classic projects in the works or recently released, along with their GitHub pages if available and developer contact info.  If you would like to add your name or project simply make a fork with changes and then a pull request.

Note: This page is not affiliated with the retired ETCDevs team, nor is this page any sort of official team, but rather a collection of links of individual projects, related code if available, and developers working on ETC related projects.
Users with ideas for projects can create an issue with a feature request and if anyone is interested and able, they may take you up on it.

Note2:  This GitHub is super new and under construction. List of links and projects coming soon!
